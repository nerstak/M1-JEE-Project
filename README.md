## Installation

### Versions

#### Version 1

Use the branch `version1`. You are able to run a deployed version using `docker-compose up -d` once the project is built using Maven. You don't need to setup the database or the server.

If you wish to use Glassfish, follow the instructions below.

#### Version 2

Use the branch `main`. Because of the differences between Glassfish and Wildfly as application servers, you cannot use the same setup. Please follow the instructions below.

### Database

#### Set up of PostgreSQL with Glassfish

For more information on how to use Glassfish and PostgreSQL, please read the following [documentation](https://github.com/nerstak/M1-JEE-Project/blob/main/doc/Use%20Postgress%20with%20Glassfish.md).

#### Set up of the database with PostgreSQL

For more information on how to set up our database, please read the following [documentation](https://github.com/nerstak/M1-JEE-Project/blob/main/doc/Setup%20database%20with%20PostgreSQL.md).

#### Connection to the database with Java

The login, password and url connection to the database are stored inside the [db.properties](https://github.com/nerstak/M1-JEE-Project/blob/main/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/db.properties) file.   
Those strings are used in the DataServices classes, for the version 1.

For the version 2, credentials are stored inside the [persistence.xml](https://github.com/nerstak/M1-JEE-Project/blob/main/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml) file.

### Building

`mvn package`

## Tests

Note that tests are only available in the Version 2.

### Unit testing coverage

Unitary tests have been set up for most of our code base. The only part not tested are the models (EJB), because they are only beans with no complexity.

To run the tests, use `mvn clean package`. 

Every information related to these tests will be displayed in the terminal.

### Static testing

SonarQube has been set up to provide some static testing on the software. It provides informations on potential bugs, security risks and mistakes. Thanks to this tool, we have been able to reduce errors. To use it, please see this [documentation](https://github.com/nerstak/M1-JEE-Project/blob/main/doc/Setup%of%sonarqube.md).

### JMeter testing

JMeter has been used to have some performance tests. However, while you have JMeter file located inside the `jmeter` folder that is working, you may not be able to use it: it has been built with different UUIDs for the data. Some screenshots have been placed inside the report.

## Code Example

## Installation
### Database 

#### Setup database with PostgreSQL

For the first time, you need to follow every step. After that, you'll only need to run scripts from [Database setup](#database-setup).

#### User setup

You need to create a user (`adm`) to interact with the database.  We assume that you know how to run script to PostgreSQL engine through the shell or the IDE.

Run the script `User Setup.sql` while being connected to Postgres database.

#### Database setup

The creation of the database is separated in two scripts, because they will not be executed in the same database.

#### Database in itself

Run the script `DB create.sql` while being connected to Postgres database.

#### DDL

Run the script `JEE db.sql` while being connected to st2eedb database.

#### Populate

Run the script `Populate.sql` while being connected to st2eedb database.

#### Connect to the database with Java

The login, password and url connection to the database are stored inside the db.properties file.   
Those strings are used in the DataServices classes.
